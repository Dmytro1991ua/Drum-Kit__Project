Hey Everyone. Welcome to my journey as a Front-End Developer where I am striving to implement my knowledge by doing some projects. It is a truly tough and thorny way but enormously exciting at the same time

# Drum-Kit__Project

#### A project of an awesome Drum Kit. The штspiration for this project has come after Wes Bos Javascript 30 day challenge. The project seems to be quite simple, but I couldn't help myself and just passed by as a huge fan of Hard Rock and Heavy Metal, in particular, drum kits.

#### HTML/HTML5, CSS3, BEM, JS, Responsive Web Design, Mobile First Approach.
